**Architecture Guard** is a repository-native governance layer for Spec Kit that helps AI agents follow the architecture rules you already defined, surface DRY and boundary drift early, and keep architecture review visible during delivery instead of waiting until code review.

✨ **NEW in v1.11.0: Built-in Pragmatism, DRY, and Hygiene Guards!**  
You no longer need to install separate agent skills for code minimalism, duplicated logic cleanup, or repository cleanliness—Architecture Guard now has them built directly into its orchestrated workflows:
* **Ponytail Pragmatism:** Enforces the "lazy senior developer" mindset (YAGNI, minimal dependencies, one-liners) natively during implementation. *(Inspired by the [Ponytail Pragmatism Skill](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail))*
* **DRY Cleanup Guidance:** Helps brownfield projects find duplicated business logic, validation, DTO mapping, and orchestration, then turn them into small refactor tasks instead of copy-paste drift.
* **Brownfield Discovery + Verification:** Maps the current codebase, surfaces architectural drift early, and confirms approved refactors actually made it into the final work.
* **Repository Hygiene Guard:** Automatically detects stray `*-copy.ts` drafts, orphaned code, and debug artifacts before they hit your main branch. [Learn more →](docs/repository-hygiene.md)

## Core Value: Architecture Guidance Without Hidden Drift

Architecture Guard uses a layered, reviewable workflow to keep architecture decisions explicit:

| Layer | Focus | What It Prevents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance** | High-level engineering rules | Loose, inconsistent project standards |
| **Architecture** | Boundaries, ownership, and contracts | Drift between modules and layers |
| **Workflow** | Reviews and refactor generation | Hidden architecture debt |

### Why Developers and Teams Use It:

- architecture decisions stop living only in people’s heads
- drift becomes visible as refactor work instead of silent debt
- smaller models get clearer rules to follow
- architecture checks happen during delivery, not only at review time
- the same ideas work across Laravel, NestJS, Next.js, Django, and more

## Why Use the Governed Workflows?

Instead of running the raw Spec Kit commands (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`), you should use Architecture Guard's orchestrated commands (`governed-spec`, `governed-plan`, `governed-tasks`).

Using the governed orchestrators simplifies the upper Spec Kit flow by adding automatic layers of safety:
1. **Context-Aware:** It automatically queries `flash-mem` first to inject historical architectural decisions before generating any new outputs.
2. **Unified Execution:** A single command runs the core Spec Kit generation (like `/speckit.specify` or `/speckit.tasks`), hands it off to Security Review, and then triggers the Architecture Guard.
3. **Analyst Auto-Fix Loops:** Rather than finding out your plan violates architecture at the end, the orchestrators use formal analysis (`/speckit.analyze`). If the analyst detects gaps, missing boundaries, or severities, the orchestrator automatically pauses and offers a loop to clarify and repair the artifacts instantly.
4. **Ponytail Pragmatism:** The best feature of these workflows—they enforce a "lazy senior developer" mindset. This prevents over-engineering, minimizes external dependencies, and strictly enforces YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) during specification and implementation to keep your codebase lean.

This guarantees your specifications and tasks are explicitly validated *before* writing code, and implemented as simply as possible.

## Quick Start

Choose the path that matches your repository state.

### Brownfield Quick Start

Use this when the repository already contains application code.

1. Install the extension

From the Spec Kit extensions registry:
```text
specify extension add architecture-guard
```

Or directly from the release artifact:
```text
specify extension add architecture-guard --from \
  https://github.com/DyanGalih/spec-kit-architecture-guard/archive/refs/tags/v1.11.0.zip
```

2. Map the existing codebase

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.init-brownfield
```

3. Run an architecture review

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-workflow
```

If violations appear, apply approved refactors:

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply
```

### Greenfield Quick Start

Use this when the repository is greenfield or when you want to define constitutions first.

1. Install the extension

From the Spec Kit extensions registry:
```text
specify extension add architecture-guard
```

Or directly from the release artifact:
```text
specify extension add architecture-guard --from \
  https://github.com/DyanGalih/spec-kit-architecture-guard/archive/refs/tags/v1.11.0.zip
```

2. Initialize your constitutions

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.init
```

3. Run an architecture review

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-workflow
```

If violations appear, apply approved refactors:

```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply
```

## Command Directory

| Command | When To Use | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.init-brownfield`** | For existing codebases | Maps the current state, boundaries, and conventions before governance work. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.init`** | At project setup or when standards change | Creates or refines governance and architecture constitutions. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-workflow`** | For an end-to-end review | Reviews specs, plans, tasks, and implementations for drift and refactors. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.governed-spec`** | Specification Phase | Orchestrates specify and clarify with architecture and memory context validation, plus an auto-fix loop. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-review`** | After `/specify`, `/plan`, or `/implement` | Checks a spec, plan, or implementation against architecture rules. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.refactor-generator`** | After violations are found | Converts violations into structured refactor tasks. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply`** | When refactors are approved | Injects approved architecture work into plans and tasks. |
| **`/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-verify`** | Final validation step | Checks whether the final work matches the approved tasks. |

## Design Philosophy

- **Non-blocking by default**: violations become refactor tasks unless a rule is explicitly marked blocking
- **Reviewable in Git**: the rules live in markdown files, not hidden state
- **Architecture first**: the extension focuses on boundaries, ownership, and drift
- **Companion-aware**: it can orchestrate other Spec Kit tools without depending on them
- **Ponytail Pragmatism (YAGNI)**: baked-in "lazy senior developer" mindset to actively prevent bloat and over-engineering across all phases of delivery

## Versioning Policy

This project strictly adheres to [Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Version numbers follow the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:
- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes,
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** version when making backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Brownfield init

See the Quick Start above for the brownfield entrypoint.
If you are specifically cleaning up duplicated logic, follow the [DRY Cleanup Guide](docs/dry-cleanup.md) after the brownfield mapping pass.
