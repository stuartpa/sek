# Repository Hygiene Guard

Architecture Guard includes a **Repository Hygiene Guard** capability. This feature ensures that AI-assisted development produces a clean, maintainable repository before code is committed or merged.

It focuses on detecting implementation artifacts and repository hygiene issues commonly left behind by rapid development workflows, such as temporary files, AI scratch files, and debug logging.

## Core Philosophy

* **Framework Agnostic**: Works across all programming languages and frameworks.
* **Non-destructive**: Never deletes files automatically. It provides actionable recommendations.
* **Advisory by Default**: In `architecture-review`, it provides a report. In `architecture-verify`, it can fail the build based on your `fail_on` configuration.
* **Extensible**: Add custom rules by placing markdown files in the `hygiene-rules/` directory.

## Configuration

You can configure Repository Hygiene in your project by creating a `.specify/config/repository_hygiene.yml` file, or by embedding a `repository_hygiene:` block in your `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md` file.

Example configuration:

```yaml
repository_hygiene:
  enabled: true

  # Elevates findings to CRITICAL severity (fails verify)
  fail_on:
    - critical

  # Sets findings to Warning severity
  warn_on:
    - warning

  ignore:
    paths:
      - docs/archive/**
      - playground/**
      - coverage/**
      - tmp/**
      
    files:
      - README.draft.md
      
    patterns:
      - "*.generated.*"
```

## Built-in Checks

The following hygiene categories are checked by default:

- **Temporary Files**: `*.tmp`, `*.bak`, `*.old`, `tmp/`
- **AI Scratch Files**: `*-copy.*`, `old-service.*`, draft implementations.
- **Debug Artifacts**: `console.log`, `print`, `var_dump`, `debug.log`.
- **Empty Files**: Files with no meaningful implementation.
- **Duplicate Experimental Files**: `service_new.ts`, `service_v2.ts`.
- **Duplicate Business Logic**: Repeated rules, validations, mappings, or orchestration that should be centralized in one shared source of truth. This rule is a good candidate for `Critical` severity if you want DRY violations to fail `architecture-verify`.
- **Orphaned Files**: Files with no references from entry points or exports.
- **Dead Documentation**: Outdated implementation notes and scratch documents.
- **TODO / FIXME**: Unresolved markers (configurable severity).
- **Commented-Out Code**: Large blocks of disabled source code.
- **Generated Artifacts**: Compiled outputs accidentally committed.

## Custom Rules

You can add custom rules by placing markdown files into the `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/hygiene-rules/` directory. 

Each rule should follow this format:

```markdown
# Rule: [Rule Name]
**Identifier**: `rule-identifier`
**Description**: What this rule detects.
**Default Severity**: Warning | Critical | Info
**Recommendation**: How to fix it.

## Detection Logic
Instructions for the agent on how to scan for this issue.
