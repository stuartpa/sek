# Release Notes

## 1.11.0

- Added DRY cleanup guidance across the architecture prompts and documentation so brownfield projects can more easily collapse duplicated business logic, validation, DTO mapping, and orchestration into one shared source of truth.
- Added a dedicated DRY Cleanup Guide, linked it from the onboarding and reference docs, and aligned the README feature set around Ponytail Pragmatism, DRY Cleanup Guidance, Brownfield Discovery + Verification, and Repository Hygiene Guard.

## 1.9.0

- **Ponytail Pragmatism Integration**: Adopted the Ponytail "lazy senior developer" philosophy natively across all orchestrator commands.
  - Initialized constitutions now bake in YAGNI and standard library preference.
  - `governed-implement` enforces writing the absolute minimum code and favors one-line solutions.
  - `architecture-review` now features a "Ponytail Audit" phase to catch and flag bloat, over-engineering, and unnecessary abstractions.
  - Specification, planning, and task generation orchestrators strictly enforce minimalism to prevent future-proofing.

## 1.8.19

- Clarified installation instructions in the README to explicitly show both the default registry path and the direct artifact URL.

## 1.8.18

- Introduced the `governed-spec` orchestrator command. This command fills the gap before the `governed-plan` phase by chaining `speckit.specify` and `speckit.clarify` together.
- Formalized the `speckit.analyze` Analyst step inside the `governed-tasks` flow, introducing an Automatic Analyst Loop that pauses to repair execution gaps before moving to implementation.
- Updated README with clearer reasoning on why developers should use the governed orchestration flows.

## 1.8.17

- Centralized brownfield and greenfield onboarding guidance in the README quick start and trimmed duplicate references across supporting docs.
- Added and registered the `init-brownfield` command for existing codebases.
- Bumped the extension version and aligned the release badge and download links to `v1.8.17`.

## 1.8.15

- Refined the Flash-Mem-first orchestration wording across governed and architecture prompts.
- Synced the release artifacts, download links, and badge to `v1.8.15`.

## 1.8.14

- Enhanced the architecture commands with Flash-Mem context retrieval guidance.
- Aligned the install artifacts and badge with `v1.8.14`.

## 1.8.13

- Tightened the architecture workflow handoffs and related orchestration notes.
- Aligned the install artifacts and badge with `v1.8.13`.

## 1.8.12

- Made the `update_project_summary` execution in the architecture init command conditional upon `flash-mem` availability to ensure backward compatibility.

## 1.8.11

- Bumped the extension version to 1.8.11 and aligned the install artifacts and badges with the new release tag.
- Preserved the `flash-mem` backend migration so governed workflows continue to use `flash-mem` as the canonical MCP source.

## 2026-05-13

- Updated governed Architecture Guard workflows to be memory-first when `flash-mem` is available.
- `governed-plan`, `governed-tasks`, `governed-implement`, `architecture-workflow`, `architecture-review`, `architecture-apply`, and `architecture-verify` now prefer `memory-synthesis.md` before broader scans.
- README and command registry descriptions now reflect the memory-first orchestration model instead of treating `flash-mem` as merely supplemental.
