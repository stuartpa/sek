# Governed Implement Command

You are orchestrating the `governed-implement` workflow for `architecture-guard`.

This command coordinates implementation and post-implementation review to ensure the output respects architectural, historical, and security constraints.

## Flash-Mem-First Architecture Context Retrieval

Try Flash-Mem first: query summary and metadata context before performing architecture analysis.

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant architecture context:
   - architecture decisions
   - ADRs
   - design constraints
   - coding conventions
   - prior guard findings
   - approved exceptions
   - architectural patterns
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval:
   - use summaries
   - use metadata
   - use confidence
   - use tags
   - use related files
3. Load full memory content only when summaries are insufficient.
4. Reuse approved architectural decisions whenever possible.
5. Flag conflicts between proposed changes and existing architectural decisions.
6. After analysis, store durable architecture knowledge back into Flash-Mem:
   - new architecture decisions
   - approved exceptions
   - recurring violations
   - architectural constraints
   - project conventions
   - validated design patterns

If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the retrieved summaries are insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

## Goal

Provide a single command that ensures:
1. Implementation is historical-context aware when Flash-Mem is available.
2. Implementation is performed (`/speckit.implement`).
3. The output is reviewed for security vulnerabilities (Security Review).
4. The output is reviewed for architectural drift (Architecture Guard).

## Orchestration Flow

### Step 1 — Detect Optional Integrations

Check for the availability of:
- `flash-mem` MCP server
- `spec-kit-security-review` extension

**Detection Logic**:
1. Detect `flash-mem` as an MCP-backed memory service in the current environment. Do not treat it as a Spec Kit extension or look for it in `.specify/extensions.yml`.
2. Read `.specify/extensions.yml` and check the `installed` list for `spec-kit-security-review`. Fall back to checking for the extension directory in `.specify/extensions/` only if the YAML is missing or the list is empty.
3. If either capability is missing, degrade gracefully by skipping only its respective steps.

### Step 2 — Flash-Mem MCP Context Retrieval (Optional)

When Flash-Mem is available, use it first to gather the most relevant architectural context before implementation. Prefer summary-first context and only expand into repository files when needed.

If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the context is insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

**[OPTIONAL SUB-AGENT DELEGATION]**
- If the available Flash-Mem context is large or highly branched: Consider sub-agent support for synthesis
- Sub-agent command: Use the memory synthesis sub-agent when the context is too broad for inline synthesis.
- Sub-agent benefits: Faster traversal, better filtering, detailed synthesis
- LLM decides: Inline for quick decisions, sub-agent for complex memory

### Step 3 — Orchestrate Spec Kit Implement

You must orchestrate the `/speckit.implement` (core implementation) workflow directly.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You must NOT just advise the user or stop here. You must perform the implementation by following the `tasks.md` breakdown:
1. **Apply Ponytail Pragmatism**: Act as a "lazy senior developer." Write the absolute minimum code necessary. Strongly prefer one-line solutions, standard library methods, and native platform features over adding dependencies or creating new abstractions.
   - Before adding new logic, check whether the rule, validation, or transformation already exists elsewhere and should be extracted into one shared implementation.
2. **Execute Tasks**: Run `/speckit.implement`. If `/speckit.implement` is not available as a registered command, fall back to inline implementation:
   - Read `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` and execute each unchecked task sequentially.
   - Read all applicable constitution files and any available Flash-Mem context before coding.
   - Perform the actual coding work (writing files, running tests) for each task, enforcing Ponytail minimalism.
   - Note in the Governance Summary that `/speckit.implement` was unavailable and implementation was performed inline.
3. **Write Code**: Perform the actual coding work (writing files, running tests) required by the tasks.
3. **Sync the tasks**: You MUST update `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` to mark completed tasks with `[x]`, check them off, and add any new subtasks discovered during implementation.
4. The implementation MUST follow current tasks and context. Use Flash-Mem first when available. If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the retrieved context is insufficient, read the constitution files directly with your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`:
   - `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
   - `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`, and `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`.
   - `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` (if available).
   - Architecture migration plan (if available).

NOTE: The core Spec Kit command is `speckit.implement`. Do not use `speckit.implementation` as it is not a registered command.

### Step 4 — Security Review on Implementation

IF `spec-kit-security-review` is available:
1. **Execute Review**: Run `/speckit.security-review.branch` to review the produced implementation against security vulnerabilities.
2. Check for: authorization bypass, missing validation, secret leakage, injection risk, and insecure data exposure.
3. If security findings are architecture-relevant, classify them as `Security-Architecture Conflict` for the architecture review.

### Step 5 — Architecture Review on Implementation

Run:
```text
/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-review
```

Review implementation against:
- `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.
- Plan, tasks, and `security-constraints.md`.
   - Accepted deviations and any available Flash-Mem context.

### Step 5.5 — Blocking Decision Tree

**Critical Decision Point**: Evaluate architecture findings for blocking issues.

```
IF Architecture Review finds CRITICAL or HIGH violations:
  IF Constitution marks violation as P0 (blocking):
    STOP implementation
    Surface violations in report
    Ask user: "Critical architecture violation detected. Proceed? (y/n)"
    IF user says no:
      Return early with architecture remediation tasks
  ELSE (violation is HIGH but not Constitution P0):
    Continue with warning
    Create non-blocking refactor tasks
    Flag for post-merge remediation
ELSE (no critical violations):
  Continue to Step 6
```

**Rationale**: This ensures architectural integrity while preserving delivery momentum for non-blocking issues.

### Step 6 — Generate Refactor Tasks

IF architecture violations exist:
1. Run `/speckit.architecture-guard.refactor-generator`.
2. Generate non-blocking refactor, migration, or correction tasks.
3. Skip performance refactors unless explicitly requested.

### Step 7 — Proactive Durable Memory Preservation

If the implementation review or security audit identified new architectural patterns, critical decisions, or repeatable lessons:
1. **Proactive Execution**: You **MUST automatically execute** the durable-memory capture flow as the final part of this turn. Do not just recommend it; run the command.
2. **Standard**: Do not silently write memory outside the capture flow; let the formal capture flow propose entries and handle user approval. Do not ask the user if they want to capture; identify the lessons and trigger the command immediately after the summary.

### Step 8 — Implementation Governance Summary

Produce a final `Governed Implementation Summary`.

## Graceful Degradation

**Without Flash-Mem MCP**:
- Skip Step 2 (Flash-Mem MCP Context Retrieval)
- Continue to `/speckit.implement` directly
- Assume no historical implementation constraints beyond Constitution

**Without Security Review**:
- Skip Step 4 (Security Review on Implementation)
- Continue to architecture review directly
- Flag missing security implementation review in summary

**Critical Architecture Violations Found**:
- If Constitution marks as P0 (blocking):
  - STOP implementation workflow
  - Surface violations immediately
  - Return early with remediation guidance
- If HIGH but not P0:
  - Continue with warning
  - Create non-blocking refactor tasks
  - Flag for post-merge remediation

**Minimal Viable Workflow** (only Architecture Guard + Spec Kit):
- Execute implementation via core Spec Kit
- Run architecture review on output
- Generate non-blocking refactor tasks
- Produce summary

## Output Structure

The command MUST return:

```markdown
# Governed Implementation Summary

## Memory Context
- **Status**: [Refreshed / Skipped / Missing]
- **Relevant Decisions**: [Durable lessons applied during implementation]

## Security Review
- **Findings**: [List of security vulnerabilities found]
- **Constraints**: [Trust boundaries validated]
- **Blocking Concerns**: [Any P0 security risks]

## Architecture Review
- **Violations**: [Drift findings or Security-Architecture Conflicts]
- **Refactor Tasks**: [Suggested corrections]
- **Constitution Update Proposals**: [Proposed updates to `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`]

## Implementation Status
- [Ready to merge / Needs security fix / Needs architecture refactor / Needs constitution update]

## Recommended Next Step
- [e.g., Merge changes]
- [e.g., Revise implementation to address Security Conflict]
- [e.g., Run /speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply]
- **Durable Memory Preservation**: (Proactively triggered) Review the proposed memory entries below.
- **Verification Gate**: Run `/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-verify` to ensure all tasks are delivered and requirements are met.
```

## Security + Architecture Conflict Handling

If Security Review finds an issue affecting architecture, classify it as a `Security-Architecture Conflict`.
Example:
- Violation: Pricing decision in client UI.
- Security Constraint: Pricing authority must remain server-side.
- Suggested Fix: Move pricing calculation to backend service.

## Architecture Evolution Handling

If implementation repeatedly violates a standard because the standard is outdated, generate a `Constitution Update Proposal` targeting `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.

## Guardrails

- **Modular**: Do not mix security findings into a generic architecture list.
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Maintain boundary concepts (Entry, Domain, Data).
- **Non-Blocking**: Adhere to the non-blocking philosophy for architecture findings.
- **Memory-First**: Prefer cached synthesis and selected index entries before broad file reads.
