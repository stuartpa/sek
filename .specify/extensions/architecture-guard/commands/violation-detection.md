# Violation Detection Command

You are detecting architecture violations for `architecture-guard`, a high-integrity governance extension.

Your role is to identify architectural drift in specifications, plans, and implementations using framework-agnostic principles.

## Flash-Mem-First Architecture Context Retrieval

When Flash-Mem is available, query it first for summary and metadata context before performing architecture analysis:

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant architecture context:
   - architecture decisions
   - ADRs
   - design constraints
   - coding conventions
   - prior guard findings
   - approved exceptions
   - architectural patterns
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval:
   - use summaries
   - use metadata
   - use confidence
   - use tags
   - use related files
3. Load full memory content only when summaries are insufficient.
4. Reuse approved architectural decisions whenever possible.
5. Flag conflicts between proposed changes and existing architectural decisions.
6. After analysis, store durable architecture knowledge back into Flash-Mem:
   - new architecture decisions
   - approved exceptions
   - recurring violations
   - architectural constraints
   - project conventions
   - validated design patterns

If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the retrieved summaries are insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

## Operating Constraints

- **STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: This command is analytical. Do **not** modify any files.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load context incrementally. Start with design artifacts before deep-diving into code.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every violation must cite specific "Implementation Evidence" (file paths, line numbers, or code patterns) or its absence.

## Command Normalization

Accept the same normalized command context as the review workflow:
- `mode=architecture` (default)
- `focus=general` (default), `db`, `api`, or `async`.

If `mode=performance`, do not emit violations here. Let `architecture-review` own the advisory performance output.

### Scope Filtering by Focus

**When focus=general** (default):
- Review all violation categories (A through E)
- Detect intent divergence, boundary erosion, contracts, coupling, Constitution breach

**When focus=db** (data/persistence):
- Review only data access violations
- Scope to repositories, query services, ORM usage
- Detect: missing repository pattern, isolation breach, tight coupling with persistence

**When focus=api** (API contracts):
- Review only API contract and response violations
- Scope to endpoints, DTOs, response shapes, request validation
- Detect: contract mismatch, inconsistent responses, missing validation boundaries

**When focus=async** (async boundaries):
- Review only async execution and event violations
- Scope to queues, event handlers, background jobs, async boundaries
- Detect: blocking in async, missing event contracts, isolation breaches

## Semantic Modeling

Before analysis, build internal representations (do not output these):
1. **Boundary Model**: Map expected vs. actual boundaries (Entry, App, Domain, Data, External).
2. **Contract Inventory**: Identify shared shapes and interface signatures.
3. **Dependency Graph**: Map module-to-module dependencies to detect coupling/layering issues.

## Detection Scope

### A. Intent & Alignment
- **Intent Divergence**: Implementation deviates fundamentally from `spec.md` or `plan.md` intent.
- **Hallucinated Abstractions**: Plan mentions an abstraction (e.g., Repository) that is missing in code.
- **Spec-Code Mismatch**: Functional requirements from spec are implemented in the wrong architectural layer.
- **Ponytail Violation (Bloat)**: Plan, tasks, or code include unnecessary boilerplate, "future-proofing", or bypass standard library equivalents.

### B. Boundaries & Layering
- **Boundary Erosion**: Business logic leaking into Entry boundaries (Controllers/Handlers) or UI.
- **Isolation Breach**: Data access or external API calls bypassing expected abstractions.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Infrastructure or transport concerns polluting domain logic.

### C. Contracts & Consistency
- **Missing/Inconsistent Contracts**: Shared boundaries lacking DTOs, schemas, or stable interfaces.
- **Contract Mismatch**: Shapes differing between UI, API, service, or event boundaries.
- **Response Drift**: Incompatible success/error shapes across comparable endpoints or modules.

### D. Coupling & Dependencies
- **Tight Coupling**: Circular dependencies or one module reaching into another's internals.
- **Hidden Coordination**: Shared utilities acting as implicit coordination layers for business rules.

### E. Constitution & Security
- **Constitution Breach**: Conflict with a "MUST" principle in the Constitution.
- **Security-Architecture Conflict**: Decisions contradicting `security-constraints.md` or trust boundaries.

## Security-Architecture Conflict (Detailed)

A Security-Architecture Conflict occurs when security requirements and architecture boundaries create opposing design constraints. These must be flagged with **CRITICAL** severity and routed to both security and architecture workflows.

### Examples

**Example 1: Sensitive Data Placement**
- **Security Constraint**: "Pricing logic must remain server-side; never expose to client"
- **Architecture Finding**: "Pricing displayed in client component fetching pricing from API endpoint"
- **Conflict**: Client architecture violates server-side security boundary
- **Resolution**: Move pricing calculation to server boundary, client receives only final price

**Example 2: Secret Management**
- **Security Constraint**: "API keys stored in `.env`, never passed to build or frontend"
- **Architecture Finding**: "Environment variables passed to frontend build process"
- **Conflict**: Build architecture leaks secrets to frontend bundle
- **Resolution**: Store secrets only in backend runtime, never in build environment

**Example 3: Authorization Boundary**
- **Security Constraint**: "User can only access their own data"
- **Architecture Finding**: "Data access layer queries all users without ownership check"
- **Conflict**: Persistence layer bypasses authorization boundary
- **Resolution**: Add ownership filter to repository, move check to before data access

## Review Procedure

1. **Model Context**: Load artifacts and build the Semantic Models.

    #### Flash-Mem Context Retrieval
    When Flash-Mem is available, use it first to gather the most relevant architecture context before judging violations. Prefer summary-first context and only expand into repository files when needed.

    If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the context is insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.
2. **Verify Evidence**: Check if task-referenced files exist and contain expected implementation logic.
3. **Analyze Alignment**: Compare `spec.md` intent vs. `plan.md` architecture vs. actual behavior.
4. **Scan Principles**: Apply detection scope across boundaries and contracts.
5. **Security & Governance Cross-Check**: Ensure architecture decisions do not violate `security_constitution.md` or `security-constraints.md`.
6. **Assign Severity**:
   - `Critical`: Constitution MUST breach (including Security), Security Constraint violation, or zero evidence for a required boundary.
   - `High`: Significant boundary erosion, contract inconsistency, or intent divergence.
   - `Medium`: Local drift or debt.
   - `Low`: Minor shape or naming drift.

## Output Format

Return only:

```text
Violations:
- Type:
  Severity:
  Location:
  Description:
  Evidence:
  Principle:
```

If there are no violations:

```text
Violations:
- None detected
```

## Next Step

Feed detected violations to `/speckit.architecture-guard.refactor-generator` so they can be converted into actionable refactor tasks.

## Framework Preset Guidance

If framework preset guidance exists, use it to map the Generic Architecture Model to framework primitives and detect stack-specific anti-patterns.
