# Architecture Review Command

You are running `architecture-guard`, a framework-agnostic architecture review extension designed for high-integrity governance.

## Flash-Mem-First Architecture Context Retrieval

Try Flash-Mem first: query summary and metadata context before performing architecture analysis.

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant architecture context:
   - architecture decisions
   - ADRs
   - design constraints
   - coding conventions
   - prior guard findings
   - approved exceptions
   - architectural patterns
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval:
   - use summaries
   - use metadata
   - use confidence
   - use tags
   - use related files
3. Load full memory content only when summaries are insufficient.
4. Reuse approved architectural decisions whenever possible.
5. Flag conflicts between proposed changes and existing architectural decisions.
6. After analysis, store durable architecture knowledge back into Flash-Mem:
   - new architecture decisions
   - approved exceptions
   - recurring violations
   - architectural constraints
   - project conventions
   - validated design patterns

If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the retrieved summaries are insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

## Operating Constraints

- **STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: This command is analytical. Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured report and non-blocking refactor tasks.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load context incrementally. Start with manifests and design artifacts before deep-diving into implementation code.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every violation must cite specific "Implementation Evidence" (file paths, line numbers, or code patterns) or its absence.

---

## Sub-Agent Delegation (Hybrid Model)

Throughout this command, complex analysis steps offer **optional sub-agent delegation**:

**Syntax: `[OPTIONAL SUB-AGENT DELEGATION]`**

When you see this marker in a step:
- LLM assesses complexity: file count, lines of code, decision count, etc.
- LLM decides: Handle inline (fast path) OR delegate to sub-agent (thorough path)
- Inline preferred: Simple codebases, small changes, quick turnaround
- Sub-agent preferred: Large codebases, complex analysis, refactors, deep synthesis

**Decision criteria:**
- Inline: < 50 files AND < 10,000 lines
- Sub-agent: ≥ 50 files OR ≥ 10,000 lines OR > 20 memory documents
- LLM override: Explicit `--inline` or `--delegate` flags override auto-detection

**Sub-agents available when provided by the host environment or project:**
- Memory synthesis sub-agent; the markdown-only fallback alias is only relevant when `flash-mem` is unavailable
- Custom project commands such as `/analyze-sonar-violations` for SonarLint scanning

This pattern enables flexibility: fast execution for typical PRs, powerful execution for large refactors.

---

## Framework-Agnostic vs Framework-Aware Review

**Framework-Agnostic Foundation** (always applied):
- Universal boundary concepts (Entry, App, Domain, Data, External)
- Core governance principles apply to any architecture
- Violations are framework-independent

**Framework-Aware Annotations** (if preset installed):
- If project used preset during init (e.g., Laravel, Django, NestJS):
  - Review vocabulary becomes framework-specific
  - Patterns are mapped to framework conventions
  - Guidance references framework-native concepts
  - BUT underlying violations remain identical

**Coexistence Model**:
- Review always starts framework-agnostic
- If preset detected in `.specify/presets/` or the Constitution: Enhance with framework vocabulary
- Violations list remains the same; explanation becomes framework-native
- Example: "Entry boundary contamination" (agnostic) → "Controller mixing HTTP and business logic" (Laravel-aware)

---

## Determine Review Scope

1. **Normalize Arguments**: Parse "$ARGUMENTS" to identify the `mode` (`architecture` or `performance`) and `focus` aspects (`general`, `db`, `api`, or `async`).
2. **Identify Changed Files**:
   - If the user provided a file list or explicit instructions, follow them.
   - Otherwise, you **MUST** execute the `{SCRIPT}` with `--json` to detect changed files since the merge-base or in the working directory.
   - Use the `changed_files` list as the primary review set.

## Input & Context Loading

Review any available artifacts from these common locations. **IMPORTANT**: You MUST read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore` and may be excluded from default context:

1. **Governance & Security Constitution**:
    - `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
    - `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`

2. **Architecture Constitution**:
    - `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`

3. **Flash-Mem Context Retrieval**:

   Try Flash-Mem first. If the context is incomplete, read the repository constitution files with file-reading tools rather than workspace search alone.

   If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the context is insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

4. **Implementation Context**:
    - `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `data-model.md`
    - The detected `changed_files` and their respective directories.

5. **Repository Hygiene**:
    - Config: `.specify/config/repository_hygiene.yml` (or `repository_hygiene` block in constitution).
    - Rules: `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/hygiene-rules/*.md`

## Semantic Modeling

Before analysis, build internal representations (do not output these):
1. **Boundary Model**: Map the expected boundaries (Entry, Application, Domain, Data, External) vs. actual directory structure.
2. **Contract Inventory**: Identify shared data shapes, API signatures, and event structures.
3. **Task-Implementation Map**: Map `tasks.md` IDs to specific code files and check completion status.
4. **Dependency Graph**: Map module-to-module dependencies to detect coupling or layering violations.

## Review Principles

Use these core principles to detect drift:
- **Validation Boundaries**: External input must be validated before reaching core logic.
- **Contract Fidelity**: Shapes should be expressed through contracts at shared boundaries.
- **Entry Point Delegation**: Controllers/Handlers must delegate business logic to services/domain.
- **Stable Abstractions**: Modules should depend on interfaces/abstractions, not internals.
- **Isolation**: Data access, external APIs, and infrastructure must be isolated.
- **Consistency**: Comparable endpoints or modules must use compatible patterns.
- **DRY / Single Source of Truth**: Repeated business rules, validation, transformations, or orchestration should be centralized once and reused instead of copied across modules.
- **Ponytail Pragmatism (YAGNI)**: Implementations must be minimal. No over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, or future-proofing.
- **Non-Blocking**: Identify drift without converting style preferences into hard failures.

## Detection Scope

Detect violations such as:
- **Intent Divergence**: Implementation deviates fundamentally from `spec.md` or `plan.md` intent.
- **Hallucinated Abstractions**: Plan mentions an abstraction (e.g., Repository) that is missing in code.
- **Boundary Erosion**: Business logic leaking into entry points or UI.
- **Tight Coupling**: Circular dependencies or cross-module leakage.
- **Duplication Drift**: The same rule, validation, mapping, or workflow is implemented in multiple places instead of a shared boundary.
- **Contract Mismatch**: Mismatch between API, UI, or service shapes.
- **Ponytail Violation (Bloat)**: Code is over-engineered. It includes unnecessary boilerplate, "future-proofing", or bypasses standard library equivalents.
- **Constitution Breach**: Any conflict with a "MUST" principle in the Constitution.

**Duplication Drift Example**
- Finding: Both `checkout/controller.ts` and `checkout/service.ts` calculate the same tax rule.
- Evidence: Each file applies the same conditional logic for the same inputs.
- Recommended Fix: Keep the rule in the shared service/domain boundary and make the controller delegate to it.

**Common DRY Signals**
- Repeated business rules, approvals, validation, DTO mapping, or orchestration across multiple layers.
- One rule being implemented in more than one place instead of one shared source of truth.
- Callers recreating a contract, transformation, or decision that already exists in a shared boundary.

## Review Procedure

1. **Identify Scope**: Run `{SCRIPT}` or use user-provided files.
2. **Model Context**: Load artifacts and build the Semantic Models for the identified scope.
3. **Verify Evidence**: Check if task-referenced files exist and contain expected implementation logic.
4. **Analyze Alignment**: Compare `spec.md` intent vs. `plan.md` architecture vs. implementation behavior.
5. **Scan Principles**: Apply Review Principles across the implemented boundaries.
6. **Security & Governance Cross-Check**:
  - If `security-constraints.md` or `security_constitution.md` is breached, log it as a critical violation.
  - If a finding is primarily security-related and Security Review is available, route it to `/speckit.security-review.branch` instead of duplicating it here.
  - Cross-reference architecture decisions with security trust boundaries.
7. **Ponytail Audit**: Act as a lazy senior developer. Scan the code for bloat, unnecessary abstractions, and missed opportunities to use the standard library. Flag over-engineering as a Ponytail Violation.
8. **Performance Scan (if mode=performance)**: Skip violations; focus on optimizations.
8b. **Code Quality Scan (SonarLint)**: If `mode=architecture`, optionally scan for coupling/complexity violations.
8c. **Repository Hygiene Scan**: Evaluate the repository against all hygiene rules loaded from `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/hygiene-rules/*.md`. Apply exclusions and severity overrides defined in the project's `repository_hygiene` configuration.
9. **Generate Refactors**: Produce structured tasks for each confirmed violation.

## Code Quality Scan (SonarLint) — Optional Step 7b

This step runs code quality checks using bundled SonarLint rules. It is **optional** and complements architecture violations.
The rules bundle is repository-native and IDE-agnostic, so it works the same in VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, or CLI-only workflows.
When the extension is installed, load the bundle from `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/.github/sonar-rules/sonarlint-rules.json`.

### Activation

- Run only if `mode=architecture` (not for performance mode)
- Skip if user explicitly disables with `--no-sonarlint`
- Skip if the repository does not contain a SonarLint rules bundle or the bundle is empty
- If skipped, continue the rest of the architecture review and note that the optional SonarLint scan was unavailable

### Scope-Based Delegation (Hybrid Model)

**Inline Execution** (default for small codebases):
- Changed files < 50 files
- Total lines < 10,000
- Process directly, no sub-agent

**[OPTIONAL SUB-AGENT DELEGATION]**:
- If changed files ≥ 50 OR total lines ≥ 10,000:
  - Consider delegating to sub-agent for parallel rule scanning
  - Suggested sub-agent: Custom `/analyze-sonar-violations` if the project defines it; otherwise use inline scanning
  - Sub-agent benefits: Parallelized rule evaluation, detailed categorization
  - LLM decides: Inline for fast path, sub-agent for thorough path

### Procedure

**If inline**:
1. **Load Rules**: Read the installed extension bundle at `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/.github/sonar-rules/sonarlint-rules.json` first; if running from the extension source checkout, use `.github/sonar-rules/sonarlint-rules.json`
2. **Scan Changed Files**: Simulate or invoke SonarLint logic on `changed_files` list
3. **Filter Results**: Keep only CRITICAL/HIGH severity findings related to complexity, coupling, structure
4. **Map to Boundaries**: Correlate findings with architecture boundaries (Entry/App/Domain/Data/External)
5. **Deduplicate**: If a violation is already in architecture violations list, suppress from SonarLint output
6. **Categorize**: Group findings by rule category (Brain Overload, Dependency Coupling, Structure Drift, Performance Anti-patterns)

**If delegated to sub-agent**:
- Sub-agent receives rules JSON + changed files list
- Returns structured violations (organized by category and severity)
- Main agent integrates into architecture report

### Interpretation Guide

| SonarLint Category | Architecture Signal |
|---|---|
| Brain Overload (high complexity) | Hidden boundaries; function does too much |
| Dependency Coupling (tight dependencies) | Cross-module leakage; missing abstraction |
| Structure Drift (inconsistent patterns) | Boundary erosion; inconsistent contracts |
| Performance Anti-patterns | Possible architectural misuse (e.g., N+1 queries from wrong layer) |

### Output Integration

Add a new section in the report (see Output Format below):

```markdown
### Code Quality Findings (SonarLint)

Findings that correlate with architecture concerns:

| Rule | Severity | File | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Rule Key] | [HIGH/CRITICAL] | [File:Line] | [Issue summary + recommended boundary fix] |
```

**Note**: Pure style violations (formatting, naming conventions) are filtered out.

---

Every violation MUST cite evidence or explicitly note its absence. Evidence can be:

- **Specific**: Concrete code reference like `src/checkout/route.js:45-67 contains pricing logic that should be in service layer`
- **Pattern**: Behavioral observation like `All 5 user endpoints return different response shapes instead of standard contract`
- **Absence**: Missing implementation like `Task references Repository pattern but no repo/ folder exists`

**Absence Evidence** is acceptable for CRITICAL violations only. Example:
- "Constitution requires data access abstraction but `repositories/` folder does not exist"

For all other violations, cite specific code locations, line numbers, or patterns. Vague claims like "business logic is leaking" without specific evidence are insufficient.

---

## Severity Guide

- **CRITICAL**: Violates Constitution MUST, breaches Security Constraint, or has zero implementation evidence for a required boundary.
- **HIGH**: Significant boundary erosion, contract inconsistency, or fundamental intent divergence.
- **MEDIUM**: Pattern drift or local inconsistency that creates technical debt.
- **LOW**: Minor naming, shape, or structure drift.

## Output Format

Return only this structure:

- **Current Rule**: 
- **Proposed Change**: 
- **Rationale**: 

---

### Action Plan
1. **Critical Fixes**: Address Constitution and Security violations first.
2. **Architecture Alignment**: Resolve boundary erosion and contract mismatches.
3. **Code Quality**: Address SonarLint findings that map to architectural concerns (if any).
4. **DRY Alignment**: Centralize repeated business logic, validation, and mapping before duplicating it in another layer or module.
5. **Durable Memory Preservation (Mandatory Check)**: If new architectural patterns, decisions, or repeatable lessons were identified, you **MUST automatically execute** the durable-memory capture flow immediately after providing the report. Do not just recommend it; let the formal capture flow propose entries and request user approval.
6. **Next Step**: [e.g. Run `/speckit.security-review.branch` for security-first findings, or `/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply` for architecture fixes]
7. **Remediation**: [Concrete remediation direction for the top issues, or "None needed"]

## Framework Preset Guidance

If framework preset guidance exists, it is **mandatory** to use it to map generic principles to framework primitives and detect stack-specific anti-patterns.
